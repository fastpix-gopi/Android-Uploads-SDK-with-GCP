### Features:

  - **Chunking**: Files are automatically split into chunks (default chunk size is 16MB).
  - **Pause and Resume**: Allows temporarily pausing the upload and resuming after a while.

  - **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error management to notify users of issues during uploads.
  - **Customizability**: Options to customize chunk size and retry attempts.
